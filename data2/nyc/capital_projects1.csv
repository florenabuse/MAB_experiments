The Southern Brooklyn Crosstown bus route aims to improve bus speeds, reliability, and driver and pedestrian safety along a 10-mile bus route in the Borough of Brooklyn from the Gravesend to Spring Creek neighborhoods. The B82 SBS will be launched in 2018 by NYC DOT and NYCTA. The capital project focuses on the 7.5-mile portion of the entire SBS corridor along Kings Highway (Segment K), Flatlands Avenue (Segment F), and Pennsylvania Avenue (Segment P). Along these three corridors, the capital project will build a combination of new bus lanes with high-quality bus stations and signal timing changes, as well as safety improvements for bus passengers, pedestrians, and all street users. Bus stops will be rehabilitated with expanded ADA-accessible platforms, bus shelters, lighting, and seating. Concrete curb extensions and central medians will be built to reduce crossing distances. Additionally, all the medians along Kings Highway will be reconstructed bringing them to a state of good repair along with the bus stops.",Design,12/07/2017,05/09/2024

05/2019,"HVAC AIRFLOW ISSUES  This scope includes the installation of a new transfer air fan and associated ductwork with sound attenuation on the inlet and outlet of a fan serving the Judge�s Lounge located at the 7th Floor.  New transfer air ducts are being installed on floors 2, 7 & 8 to assist in the proper function of the return air system. Additional fan coil units are being installed to serve several rooms on the 8th floor & the 7th floor elevator lobby.    ENGINATOR EXHAUST HEAT  This scope involves a means of venting excessive heat that builds up in a shaft way that houses the enginator exhaust pipe that begins in lower level 2 up and out through the roof of the building. The heat emanates through the shaft way walls into the building.  This will be accomplished by installing a new exhaust fan and a makeup air fan that pumps outside air into the shaft way.    CURTAINWALL SHADOW BOX HEAT TRANSFER  Original design created conditions where curtain wall mullions heated to temperatures in excess of 110 F. This scope of works involves installing new metal stud with sheetrock finishes over interior curtain wall mullions. Affected locations are portions of the 2nd floor east side exposure.    WATER PENETRATION THROUGH UNDERGROUND CONDUITS  An existing underground conduit experienced water infiltration which caused those conductors to fail. Those conductors are going to be removed and the conduit abandoned. A new above ground path has been designed for the new feeder.    INTERIOR GLASS REPLACEMENT  Replace 4 sections of glazing at Stair A and 1 section at Stair B.
