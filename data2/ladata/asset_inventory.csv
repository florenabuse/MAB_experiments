HPOZs, commonly known as historic districts, provide for review of proposed exterior alterations and additions to historic properties within designated districts. The City Council adopted the ordinance enabling the creation of HPOZs in 1979; Angelino Heights became Los Angeles’ first HPOZ in 1983. Today, the City of Los Angeles has 29 designated HPOZs, with many more under consideration (Proposed HPOZs). HPOZ areas range in size from neighborhoods of approximately 50 parcels to more than 3,000 properties. While most districts are primarily residential, many have a mix of single-family and multi-family housing, and some include commercial and industrial properties. HPOZs are established and administered by the Los Angeles City Planning Department (in concert with the City Council). Individual buildings in an HPOZ need not be of landmark quality on their own: it is the collection of a cohesive, unique, and intact collection of historic resources that qualifies a neighborhood for HPOZ status.",05/23/2014 02:09:00 PM +0000,11/03/2020 12:39:00 AM,A Well Run City,9jxz-e3ru,Creative Commons 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication),Department of City Planning,http://preservation.lacity.org/hpoz/homepage,https://data.lacity.org/resource/upvx-bixm.json,,official,Planning OpenData
https://data.lacity.org/d/fqxv-krpf,fqxv-krpf,Planning,Federal Renewal Community,"Introduced in 1993, the Empowerment Zone (EZ), Enterprise Community (EC) , and Renewal Community (RC) Initiatives sought to reduce unemployment and generate economic growth through the designation of Federal tax incentives and award of grants to distressed communities. Local, Tribal, and State governments interested in participating in this program were required to present comprehensive plans that included the following principles:
   •Strategic Visions for Change,
   •Community-Based Partnerships,
   •Economic Opportunities, and
   •Sustainable Community Development.

Communities selected to participate in this program embraced these principles and led projects that promoted economic development in their distressed communities.

The EZ/EC initiative was implemented in the form of three competitions authorized by Congress in 1994 (round I), 1998 (round II), and 2001 (round III). These communities utilized HUD’s PERMS system to create Implementation Plans and develop Annual Reports, which can be publicly accessed here and overall, display extensive community and economic development impacts in these distressed communities.

 The EC designation expired in 2004 and EZ and RC designations generally expired at the end of 2009. However, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Re-authorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-312 extended the Empowerment Zone and DC Enterprise Zone designations to December 31, 2011.

Following the end of the EZ designation extension on December 31, 2011, the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) of 2012, signed into law by President Obama on January 2, 2013, provided for an extension of the Empowerment Zone designations until December 31, 2013. The ATRA of 2012 did not extend the designation of the DC Enterprise Zone.

 For the EZ designation extension, IRS Notice 2013-38 issued on May 29, 2013 (see link under the “What’s New” heading on the left) explained a one step process stating that “any nomination for an Empowerment Zone that was in effect on December 31,...",05/23/2014 02:01:00 PM +0000,11/03/2020 12:39:00 AM,A Well Run City,9jxz-e3ru,Creative Commons 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication),Department of City Planning,http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/comm_planning/economicdevelopment/programs/rc,https://data.lacity.org/resource/fqxv-krpf.json,,official,Planning OpenData
